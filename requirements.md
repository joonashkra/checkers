### Rules for capturing (source: https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Checkers)
    - The space on the other side of your opponent’s checker has to be empty so that you can move into it.
    - If you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker, then the rules state you must jump it.
    - If you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker in multiple parts of the board, then you can choose which checkers you'd like to jump.
    - If the new position you land in gives you a direct opportunity to capture another checker, then you must keep going until you can't capture any more of your opponent's checkers.
